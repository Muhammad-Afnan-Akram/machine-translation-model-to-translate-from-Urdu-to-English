## Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a machine translation model that can translate Urdu sentences into English. The model is designed from scratch and uses PyTorch framework.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 100000 parallel sentences of English-Urdu. The dataset is preprocessed using various techniques such as splitting, cleaning, and adding tokens to create the vocabulary.

## Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for model training, various preprocessing techniques are employed, such as splitting, cleaning, and tokenization.

## Model Architecture
The model uses encoder-decoder with attention for the translation process. The model is designed from scratch and does not use an already existing model library.

## Dataset Division
The dataset is randomly shuffled and divided into 70% train, 15% validation, and 15% test data for training, validation, and testing purposes.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive approach for designing a machine translation model for Urdu to English translation. The model and the preprocessing techniques can be extended to other languages as well. The project is available on Github, including the code, dataset, and preprocessed data.
